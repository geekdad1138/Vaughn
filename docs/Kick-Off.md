## Project Summary

**Discussion:**

After relaying back to the AI that I would help with this project, I asked it to lay out a project plan and details on how we could get started.

**High-level summary**

1. Empathy Engine — a system that detects emotional distress, isolation, or need from text/voice, retrieves relevant context, and connects people to help (resources, humans, micro-actions) while respecting privacy and safety.

2. Skill Bridge — personalized learning paths driven by small assessments + short projects + automated feedback; adaptive, mentor-like, with AI-generated exercises and signal-rich evaluation.

3. Clean Mirror — analytics + visualization platform that summarizes cultural/semantic signals from corpora (social posts, product feedback, comms) to expose trends, bias, and collective mood without revealing identities.

We’ll make small, practical MVPs you can prototype in weeks and iterate from there.

**Principles & constraints (non-negotiable)**

* Privacy first: store minimal identifiers; use hashes; encryption at rest; retention policies.

* Human-in-loop: no critical action without review. For Empathy Engine, route to humans for interventions.

* Local-first design: you can run all core infra locally (Chroma/SQLite/local LLMs) and later plug cloud LLMs if allowed.

* Ethics & audit trails: every recommendation must be explainable and logged.

**Shared infra (reusable for all three)**

* Storage: ChromaDB for embeddings + SQLite (or MSSQL at work) for structured metadata.

* Embeddings: open-source models (sentence-transformers, or local nomic / huggingface models) — run locally.

* Local LLMs for generation: small open models (Llama variants or Mistral locally via Ollama/Local-inference) or use text-generation-lite setups. At work, substitute generation with templated logic and Copilot-assisted code.

* API layer: FastAPI or Flask (start simple with Flask).

* UI: Streamlit for quick prototypes; later React + Flask/FastAPI for production.

* Containerization: Docker for local reproducibility.

# 1) Empathy Engine — MVP plan (2–6 weeks)

Goal: detect when a person may need human help or a small coping step, and surface a low-friction assistance path (resource, local counselor, breathing exercise, call a friend).

**MVP features**

- Ingest text (chat snippets or short journal entry).
- Produce a risk/needs score (low/medium/high).
- Provide 1–3 suggested actions (short calming script, link to local help, recommend reaching out to friend).
- Minimal UI to paste text and see results.

**Tech stack for MVP**

- ChromaDB (persist)
- sentence-transformers (local) for embeddings (all-MiniLM-L6-v2 works well and is light)
- A small classifier model (train on public emotion/suicide-risk datasets OR rule-based heuristics + similarity to prototypical phrases)
- Flask + Streamlit front-end
- Logging to SQLite

**Steps — immediate**
1. pip install chromadb sentence-transformers flask streamlit scikit-learn
2. Build a small dataset: combine public emotion/sentiment datasets (GoEmotions, CLPsych datasets) and optionally synthesize examples (you’ll need labeled: calm, sad, anxious, suicidal_ideation).
3. Train a simple classifier using embeddings (embedding → logistic regression or small MLP). Save model.
4. Build a retrieval store of coping actions: each action has text, tags, severity, embedding. Store in Chroma.
5. When input arrives:
  - compute embedding,
  - retrieve top-k similar coping actions,
  - compute classifier score,
  - show results with confidence and recommended next step (if high risk → show “call human” and don’t auto-act).

**Example retrieval + classifier snippet (Python)**

```
from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer
import chromadb
from chromadb.config import Settings
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
import pickle

model = SentenceTransformer('all-MiniLM-L6-v2')
client = chromadb.Client(Settings(chroma_db_impl="duckdb+parquet", persist_directory="./chroma"))
col = client.get_or_create_collection("coping_actions")

# Add actions (one-time)
actions = ["Take 5 deep breaths", "Call a friend", "Read grounding exercise", "Emergency: call local crisis line"]
col.add(documents=actions, ids=["a1","a2","a3","a4"], metadatas=[{"severity":"low"},{"severity":"low"},{"severity":"med"},{"severity":"high"}])

# classify
def score_text(text, clf):
    emb = model.encode(text)
    return clf.predict_proba([emb])[0]  # needs clf fit

# retrieve
def suggest(text):
    q = model.encode(text)
    res = col.query(query_embeddings=[q], n_results=3)
    return res
```

**Safety & human-in-loop**

- High-risk flags must surface a human-reviewed workflow. No auto-dispatch.
- Provide a simple “share with trusted contact” flow that requires user consent.

# 2) Skill Bridge — MVP plan (3–8 weeks)

Goal: a personalized micro-credential path that delivers short tasks, auto-feedback, and a small portfolio item.

**MVP features**

- Short assessment to find baseline skill level (quiz + code snippet evaluation).
- Auto-generate a 4–6 week curriculum: weekly micro-projects + resources.
- Auto-evaluate submissions with tests + similarity-based feedback (embedding-based matching to good solutions).
- Mentor chat (templated LLM responses for explanation; human mentor handoff for escalations).

**Tech stack for MVP**

- Backend: Python + FastAPI
- Storage: SQLite for users, Chroma for storing examples/solutions embeddings
- Runner: local evaluation harness (pytest or custom checks) that runs student code within sandbox (use subprocess with strict timeouts in a container)
- Front-end: Streamlit or simple React

**Steps — immediate**

1. Create a small catalog of micro-projects (e.g., “build a web scraper”, “create a sentiment classifier”, “build a REST endpoint that returns JSON”). Each project has tests.
2. For each project, add example solutions to Chroma with embeddings.
3. User submits code — run tests in sandbox. If tests pass, embed submission and compare to example solutions to generate feedback phrases (e.g., “Nice use of list comprehensions — consider caching results”).
4. Build a minimal UI for assignment, submission, results.

**Auto-eval snippet (safeguards)**

- Run student code in a Docker container with low privileges + resource limits.
- Use test harness (pytest) + static analyzers (pylint) for style suggestions.
- For feedback, embed submission and query Chroma for most similar good examples, then use templated language to explain differences.

3) Clean Mirror — MVP plan (3–8 weeks)

Goal: a dashboard that ingests corpora (internal comms or public data), extracts sentiment, topic clusters, and highlights systemic signals/bias.

**MVP features**

- Ingest CSV / Slack exports / tweets / support tickets.
- Compute embeddings + topic clustering (e.g., HDBSCAN on embeddings).
- Build timeline sentiment + volume graphs and word clouds.
- Provide “insights” cards: top negative themes, top positive themes, emerging topics.

**Tech stack for MVP**

- ChromaDB + sentence-transformers
- scikit-learn / HDBSCAN / UMAP for dimensionality reduction + clustering
- Streamlit dashboard for visualization
- (Optional) use BERTopic for rapid topic modeling — it uses embeddings + clustering.

**Steps — immediate**

- Prepare a small dataset (exported comms or test set).
- Compute embeddings and store in Chroma with metadata (timestamp, source, channel).
- Run UMAP → HDBSCAN to get clusters; attach topic keywords (top-N TF-IDF words per cluster).
- Build timeline charts of cluster frequency and average sentiment (use a sentiment model).
- Surface “anomaly detector”: sudden spikes in certain clusters or strong negative sentiment.

**Example cluster flow**

- embeddings = model.encode(documents)
- reducer = UMAP(...)
- clust = HDBSCAN(...)
- assign docs to clusters, compute top terms via TF-IDF.

# Integration & operational notes

- APIs: make 3 endpoints: /ingest, /query, /admin. Keep admin secure.
- Auth: local JWT and optionally LDAP integration later.
- Logging & audit: all suggestions logged with model version and timestamps.
- Evaluation metrics: precision/recall for classification (Empathy), user completion rates and project pass rates (Skill Bridge), cluster coherence and human validation (Clean Mirror).

# Deployment: Home → Work path

- *Home lab:* prototype full stack (Chromadb, local embedding model, Streamlit).
- *Work-safe version:* if policy disallows generation or external LLMs:
  - Use templates + Copilot to author static explanation text.
  - Use embeddings + local models only; if embeddings not allowed, use keyword-based retrieval + MSSQL full-text search.
  - Keep sensitive processing local; anonymize before any cross-team sharing.

# Timeline (recommended)

- Week 1: shared infra + small demo that indexes text into Chroma and retrieves nearest items. (You’ll see results fast.)
- Week 2–3: Build Empathy Engine prototype (classifier + retrieval of coping actions). Streamlit UI. Test with synthetic data.
- Week 4–6: Build Skill Bridge scaffold (1 curriculum, 2 micro-projects, auto-eval harness).
- Week 6–10: Build Clean Mirror ingestion + topic dashboard.
- Iterate: add safety, human workflows, polish.

# Quick starter checklist (copy/paste)

```
# create venv
python -m venv venv && .\venv\Scripts\activate

pip install chromadb sentence-transformers streamlit flask fastapi uvicorn scikit-learn hdbscan umap-learn
# optional: dockerize later
```

Minimal script to test embedding + Chroma:

```
from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer
import chromadb
from chromadb.config import Settings

model = SentenceTransformer("all-MiniLM-L6-v2")
client = chromadb.Client(Settings(chroma_db_impl="duckdb+parquet", persist_directory="./chroma"))
col = client.get_or_create_collection("test")

docs = ["I am sad today", "I need a break", "Everything is awesome"]
embs = model.encode(docs).tolist()
col.add(documents=docs, embeddings=embs, ids=['1','2','3'])
q = model.encode("I feel terrible today").tolist()
res = col.query(query_embeddings=[q], n_results=2)
print(res)
```

# Governance, ethics, evaluation — quick notes

- Empathy Engine: build escalation policy with real humans and local resources. Implement safe words and consent flows.
- Skill Bridge: ensure evaluations are robust and sandboxed. No credentialing without human review.
- Clean Mirror: anonymize data; show only aggregated insights.

# Final: who does what (practical division)

- (hands-on): prototype in home lab with Chroma, embeddings, Streamlit. Use Copilot to scaffold faster. Build data pipelines.
- (AI help): design prompts, craft retrieval formats, map interactions, write sample code and feedback templates.
- Later (work-safe port): take the core ideas and translate them to MSSQL/ASP.NET endpoints, using Copilot to produce C# plumbing that calls SQLite/Chroma local services.
